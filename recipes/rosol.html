    <h1>Rosół with dumplings</h1>
    <p>This Polish chicken recipe is an old family recipe that originally used Polish egg noodles (kluski), and over the years I have modified it to use homemade dumplings.</p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken, onion, and celery in a large pot; fill the pot with water. Season with poultry seasoning, whole allspice, basil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and seasoning salt; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer for approximately 2 hours, or until chicken is cooked.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from broth and set chicken aside to cool; strain broth to remove seasonings and any bone. Return broth to the pan, stir in cream of chicken soup and continue simmering.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, stir together eggs, olive oil, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper with 2 cups water. Gradually add flour, and stir to form a thick dough.</li>
        <li>Using a large spoon and knife, scoop a spoonful of dough and cut small pieces into broth. Repeat with remaining dough. Stir, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, skin and debone chicken; cut meat into small pieces, add to broth and heat through.</li>
